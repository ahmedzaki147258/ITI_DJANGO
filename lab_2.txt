Django Lab 2: Build a Simple Blog Using Models

Objective:
Create a basic blog using Django to practice working with models, views, templates, and URLs.

The blog should consist of 3 pages:

1. A Home page that lists all blog posts by title.

2. A Detailed Post page that displays the post's title, date posted, author's full name, image, post content, and a comments section.
   Note: This page should be accessible when clicking on the post title from the Home page.

3. An Author Profile page that displays the author's full name, email, phone number, and the number and titles of the books they have written.

Essential Functional Requirements:
- Use Django's built-in tools to create views, models, and render templates.
- Store Posts with the following fields: title, image_url (or image file this is for bonus), and content.
- Store Authors with the following fields: first_name, last_name, phone_number, and email.
- Store Comments with the following fields: content and posted_by (use static data for now).
- Make each post title on the homepage clickable to navigate to the post detail page.
- Make each author's name clickable to navigate to the author's profile page from the post detail page.

Set Up URLs:
- The homepage (/posts/) lists all posts with clickable titles.
- The detail page (/posts/<pk>/) displays a single post's full details.

Bonus:
- Store post images as files in the model.
- Add an image field to the Author model and display it in the profile page.

Hint:
Search for how to use models.FileField or models.ImageField and how to implement file uploads in Django.
