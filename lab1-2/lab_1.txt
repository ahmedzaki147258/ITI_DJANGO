Django Lab 1: Build a Simple Blog

Objective:
Create a basic blog using Django to practice working with models, views, templates, and routing. The blog should consist of two pages:
1. A page that lists all blog posts by title.
2. A detailed post page that displays the title, image, and full text of a selected post when its title is clicked.

Requirements:
- Use Django's built-in tools to create views, and render templates.
- Store blog posts in with fields: title, image, and content.
- Link each post title on the homepage to its detail page.


Set Up URLs
   - The homepage (/posts/) lists all posts with clickable titles.
   - The detail page (/posts/<post_title>) displays a single post's full details.

Create Views and Templates
   - A view for listing all posts.
   - A view for showing the detail of one post.
   - Templates for both pages.
